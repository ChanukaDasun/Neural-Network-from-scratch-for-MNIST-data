# Neural-Network-from-scratch-for-MNIST-data
A neural network built from scratch with NumPy to classify MNIST handwritten digits. Implements forward propagation (ReLU, Softmax), cross-entropy loss, backpropagation, and gradient descent, with dataset splitting, one-hot encoding, and accuracy evaluation for end-to-end training.
